# Pipeline: copy-paste scripts (bash 3.2 safe)

Set these once. `NAMES` is the ordered section ids; the last is the hero/finale.

```bash
WORK=/tmp/scroll-world           # scratch dir for prompts, sources, frames
ASSETS=./wwwroot/assets/scroll-world # adapt to the Blazor static-web-assets project
mkdir -p "$WORK" "$ASSETS/stills" "$ASSETS/video"
NAMES="farm kitchen shop delivery plaza finale"   # <-- your section ids, in order

# Chain video model — ONE for every chained clip (SKILL Phase 4 roster).
# Must accept --start-image AND --end-image (verify: higgsfield model get <model>):
# seedance_2_0 | kling3_0 | seedance_2_0_mini (draft tier). Reference-only models can't
# hold a seam; models without --mode (e.g. kling3_0_turbo) need their own flag branch below.
VMODEL=seedance_2_0
case "$VMODEL" in                                  # per-model flags + durations (bash 3.2 safe)
  kling3_0)          VOPTS="--mode std --sound off";          DIVE_DUR=10; CONN_DUR=5 ;;  # no --resolution param on Kling
  seedance_2_0_mini) VOPTS="--mode std --resolution 720p";    DIVE_DUR=8;  CONN_DUR=5 ;;  # cheap frame-locked previz

```

Higgsfield generations take minutes — every `higgsfield ... --wait` call below is meant
to run inside a **backgrounded** script. Launch the whole script with your tool's
background/detached mode and poll the progress log; never block the foreground.

## 1. Scene stills

Write one prompt file per section to `$WORK/still_<name>.txt` (see prompts.md), then:

```bash
gen_still() { # name
  higgsfield generate create gpt_image_2 --prompt "$(cat "$WORK/still_$1.txt")" \
    --aspect_ratio 3:2 --resolution 2k --quality high --wait --wait-timeout 15m --json \
    > "$WORK/still_$1.json" 2> "$WORK/still_$1.err"
  url=$(jq -r '.[0].result_url // empty' "$WORK/still_$1.json")
  [ -n "$url" ] && curl -fsSL "$url" -o "$WORK/still_$1.png" && echo "still $1 ok" || echo "still $1 FAIL"
}
for n in $NAMES; do gen_still "$n" & done ; wait
```

Codex variant (STILLS_SOURCE=codex, SKILL Phase 2 — subscription-billed, zero
credits; ~1–3 min each, parallelize in small batches):

```bash
gen_still_codex() { # name
  codex exec -C "$WORK" -s workspace-write --skip-git-repo-check \
    'Use the image generation tool ($imagegen) to generate: '"$(cat "$WORK/still_$1.txt")"' Wide 3:2 landscape, high resolution. Save it as ./still_'"$1"'.png. Do not do anything else.' \
    > "$WORK/still_$1.codex.log" 2>&1
  [ -f "$WORK/still_$1.png" ] && echo "still $1 ok (codex)" || echo "still $1 FAIL (see .codex.log)"
}
```

Create responsive WebP sources with ffmpeg (optionally run knockout.py first for transparency):

```bash
for n in $NAMES; do
  ffmpeg -v error -y -i "$WORK/still_$n.png" -vf "scale=1280:-2" -c:v libwebp -quality 84 "$ASSETS/stills/$n.webp"
  ffmpeg -v error -y -i "$WORK/still_$n.png" -vf "scale=960:-2"  -c:v libwebp -quality 82 "$ASSETS/stills/$n-960.webp"
  ffmpeg -v error -y -i "$WORK/still_$n.png" -vf "scale=640:-2"  -c:v libwebp -quality 80 "$ASSETS/stills/$n-640.webp"
done

# First-scene CSS blur-up placeholder. Keep the output roughly 1 KB or less.
first=$(printf '%s\n' $NAMES | sed -n '1p')
ffmpeg -v error -y -i "$WORK/still_$first.png" -vf "scale=32:-2,gblur=sigma=2" \
  -c:v libwebp -quality 28 "$ASSETS/stills/$first-lqip.webp"
```

Review the stills for cohesion before continuing. Re-roll any off-style one (optionally
add `--image "$WORK/still_<good>.png"` to lock style).

## 2A. Continuous forward legs — architecture A

Generate sequentially. Each next leg starts from the previous leg's **actual final rendered frame**. Inspect that frame before paying for the next leg; it must end in the agreed gentle forward drift.

Prompt files live at `$WORK/leg_<name>.txt`.

```bash
prev=""
for n in $NAMES; do
  if [ -z "$prev" ]; then start="$WORK/still_$n.png"; else start="$WORK/last_$prev.png"; fi
  higgsfield generate create "$VMODEL" --prompt "$(cat "$WORK/leg_$n.txt")" \
    --start-image "$start" $VOPTS --aspect_ratio 16:9 --duration "$DIVE_DUR" \
    --wait --wait-timeout 20m --json > "$WORK/leg_$n.json" 2> "$WORK/leg_$n.err"
  url=$(jq -r '.[0].result_url // empty' "$WORK/leg_$n.json")
  [ -n "$url" ] || { echo "leg $n FAIL"; exit 1; }
  curl -fsSL "$url" -o "$WORK/leg_$n.mp4" || exit 1
  ffmpeg -v error -y -sseof -0.15 -i "$WORK/leg_$n.mp4" -frames:v 1 -q:v 2 "$WORK/last_$n.png"
  # Pause/review here. Re-roll this leg if the final-second motion contract is wrong.
  prev="$n"
done
```

Architecture A uses the encoded legs as section clips and `connectors: []`. Skip §§2B–4.

## 2B. Dive-in clips — architecture B

Prompt files at `$WORK/dive_<name>.txt`. Start image = the solid-bg still PNG.

```bash
gen_dive() { # name                       ($VOPTS is unquoted on purpose — word-split flags)
  higgsfield generate create "$VMODEL" --prompt "$(cat "$WORK/dive_$1.txt")" \
    --start-image "$WORK/still_$1.png" \
    $VOPTS --aspect_ratio 16:9 --duration "$DIVE_DUR" \
    --wait --wait-timeout 20m --json > "$WORK/dive_$1.json" 2> "$WORK/dive_$1.err"
  url=$(jq -r '.[0].result_url // empty' "$WORK/dive_$1.json")
  [ -n "$url" ] && curl -fsSL "$url" -o "$WORK/dive_$1.mp4" && echo "dive $1 ok" || echo "dive $1 FAIL"
}
for n in $NAMES; do gen_dive "$n" & done ; wait
```

Re-roll individual failures (503 / credit race are transient):
`gen_dive shop`  (just that one).

## 3. Extract boundary frames — architecture B seam handoff

For each adjacent pair, the connector's start = dive_i's LAST frame, end = dive_{i+1}'s
FIRST frame — extracted from the **rendered videos**, never the stills.

```bash
set -- $NAMES
prev=""
for n in "$@"; do
  ffmpeg -v error -ss 0 -i "$WORK/dive_$n.mp4" -frames:v 1 -q:v 2 "$WORK/first_$n.png"      # establishing
  ffmpeg -v error -sseof -0.15 -i "$WORK/dive_$n.mp4" -frames:v 1 -q:v 2 "$WORK/last_$n.png" # interior
done
```

## 4. Connector clips — architecture B

Prompt files at `$WORK/conn_<i>.txt` (i = 1..N-1). Iterate adjacent pairs:

```bash
gen_conn() { # i startPng endPng          (end-image required → seedance/kling3_0 only)
  higgsfield generate create "$VMODEL" --prompt "$(cat "$WORK/conn_$1.txt")" \
    --start-image "$2" --end-image "$3" \
    $VOPTS --aspect_ratio 16:9 --duration "$CONN_DUR" \
    --wait --wait-timeout 20m --json > "$WORK/conn_$1.json" 2> "$WORK/conn_$1.err"
  url=$(jq -r '.[0].result_url // empty' "$WORK/conn_$1.json")
  [ -n "$url" ] && curl -fsSL "$url" -o "$WORK/conn_$1.mp4" && echo "conn $1 ok" || echo "conn $1 FAIL"
}
set -- $NAMES ; i=0 ; prev=""
for n in "$@"; do
  if [ -n "$prev" ]; then i=$((i+1)); gen_conn "$i" "$WORK/last_$prev.png" "$WORK/first_$n.png" & fi
  prev="$n"
done ; wait
```

## 5. Encode everything for scrubbing

Native resolution (1080p from seedance std; kling3_0 std returned **720p** in testing —
never upscale, encode what ffprobe reports), crf 20, GOP 8, light sharpen, no audio,
faststart. Same for dives + connectors.

```bash
enc() { ffmpeg -v error -y -i "$1" -an -vf "unsharp=5:5:0.8:5:5:0.0" \
  -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 20 -pix_fmt yuv420p \
  -g 8 -keyint_min 8 -sc_threshold 0 -movflags +faststart "$2"; echo "enc $2 $(du -h "$2"|cut -f1)"; }

# Architecture A:
for n in $NAMES; do enc "$WORK/leg_$n.mp4" "$ASSETS/video/$n.mp4"; done

# Architecture B (run instead of the line above):
for n in $NAMES; do enc "$WORK/dive_$n.mp4" "$ASSETS/video/$n.mp4"; done
i=0; for f in "$WORK"/conn_*.mp4; do i=$((i+1)); enc "$f" "$ASSETS/video/connector-$(printf '%02d' "$i").mp4"; done
```

Now the engine config's `sections[k].clip` points at `/assets/scroll-world/video/<name>.mp4`. Architecture A uses `connectors: []`; architecture B supplies N−1 connector URLs in order.

## 6. Centre-crop mobile encodes — FALLBACK ONLY, not the mobile version

**The mobile version is the native 9:16 portrait chain (§6b).** This section's crop
encodes exist for one case: the user opted into mobile but credits can't cover the
portrait chain — and shipping them must be called out and approved, never silent
(portrait phones will see the landscape film's centre ~26%). The encode mechanics
matter either way: scrubbing sets `currentTime` every frame, and a phone decoder's
**seek cost scales with how many frames it must decode from the nearest keyframe** — so
a 1080p `-g 8` master that scrubs fine on a laptop stutters on a phone. A **smaller
frame + tighter GOP** fixes that (and halves the bytes on cellular). The crop `-m.mp4`
sibling per clip:

```bash
# 720p, GOP 4 (twice the keyframes = ~half the seek-decode work), crf 23, same sharpen/faststart.
encm() { ffmpeg -v error -y -i "$1" -an -vf "scale=-2:720,unsharp=5:5:0.6:5:5:0.0" \
  -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 23 -pix_fmt yuv420p \
  -g 4 -keyint_min 4 -sc_threshold 0 -movflags +faststart "$2"; echo "encm $2 $(du -h "$2"|cut -f1)"; }

for n in $NAMES; do encm "$WORK/dive_$n.mp4" "$ASSETS/video/$n-m.mp4"; done
i=0; for f in "$WORK"/conn_*.mp4; do i=$((i+1)); encm "$f" "$ASSETS/video/connector-$(printf '%02d' "$i")-m.mp4"; done
```

Wire the variants in the engine config — the engine serves them automatically on phones,
falling back to the desktop `clip` when a mobile one is absent:

```js
sections[k].clipMobile = '/assets/scroll-world/video/<name>-m.mp4';
connectorsMobile = ['/assets/scroll-world/video/connector-01-m.mp4', …];
```

If phone scrubbing still stutters, tighten the GOP further (`-g 2`, or `-g 1` for all-intra
= instant seeks at the cost of larger files); if cellular weight is the bigger worry, raise
`crf` (24–26) or drop to `scale=-2:600`. If the master is already 720p (e.g. kling3_0 std),
the mobile encode still pays off — the tighter GOP is what makes phone seeks cheap. All-mobile encodes stay 16:9 — the engine
centre-crops them; this is an explicitly approved fallback, never the native mobile version.

## 6b. Native 9:16 portrait chain — THE mobile version (SKILL Phase 2 opt-in)

When the user opts into mobile, this is what they get: a **parallel 9:16 chain** rendered
natively for phones and shipped as the mobile variants — never the §6 crops (those are the
no-credits stopgap). Same seam laws as the main chain — the portrait chain frame-locks
against its own rendered frames, never the landscape ones. Budget ~2N-1 video gens +
re-rolls (interiors trip the NSFW filter in portrait too); state the credit cost at the
mobile-media interview.

1. **Portrait start canvases.** Don't hand the video model a 3:2 still and hope: composite
   each scene onto a 1080×1920 canvas in the page bg colour (island at ~94% width, visual
   centre at ~45% height). The render then opens exactly on what the portrait poster shows.
   For knocked-out stills, composite the RGBA over the bg colour first.
2. **Dives/legs**: same prompt templates with a portrait clause up front ("Vertical
   portrait composition, the diorama centered with generous [bg] space above and below"),
   `--aspect_ratio 9:16`, same model/params as the main chain. Review each last frame
   before chaining, as ever.
3. **Connectors**: extract first/last frames **from the 9:16 renders** and generate 9:16
   connectors between them. A native 9:16 scene mixed into cropped-16:9 neighbours pops at
   both seams — the portrait chain must be complete, not partial.
4. **Encode** with the §6 settings but portrait-oriented scale: `scale=720:-2` (720 wide),
   `-g 4`, crf 23 → these ARE the `-m.mp4` mobile files (and they replace any §6 crop
   stopgaps that shipped earlier).
5. **Posters**: extract each 9:16 dive's first frame → webp → wire as the section's
   `stillMobile` so the poster matches the portrait video's frame 0 (no landscape→portrait
   flash when the clip paints). Engine support: `sections[k].stillMobile`.

## Notes

- `.[0].result_url` is the field on the `--wait --json` job object. `.min_result_url` is
  a lower-res preview if you ever want it.
- **NSFW fallback across models**: if one clip keeps getting flagged on seedance after
  re-rolls + prompt scrubbing, regenerate just that clip on `kling3_0` with the SAME
  start/end frames: `VMODEL=kling3_0; VOPTS="--mode std --sound off"; gen_conn 3 …` —
  then restore your chain model. This preserves positional continuity but can introduce a
  subtle grain/motion-character shift, so review that seam carefully in both directions.
- **Previz on the cheap**: run the whole chain once with `VMODEL=seedance_2_0_mini`
  (frame-locking intact, ~720p) to validate the journey and seams before spending
  full-model credits — because it's still seamless, the previz translates directly to the
  final render. Don't reach for reference-only models here: without `--start/--end-image`
  they can't hold a seam, so their output can't be chained (SKILL Phase 4 rule).
- If a whole batch stalls, check `higgsfield workspace list` for credits and
  `$WORK/*.err` for the reason.
- Concurrency: launching ~5–6 gens at once is fine; much more can trigger transient
  credit/race errors — stagger or re-roll.
